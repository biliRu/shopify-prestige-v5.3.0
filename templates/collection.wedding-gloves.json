Size fitted perfectly, the quality of the fabric was just exceptional, the cut and the seams were perfect, the box was practical and light, the delivery was prompt and overall was worth it!I am always sceptical to buy online, and I was very happy that I was able to obtain a sample with the colours by post, all free of charge. That made me decide what I truly need! Thank you Cornelia James and team<\/p><p>~ Maria L<\/p>"
