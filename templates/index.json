You may be surprised to learn that there are 2.5 meters (that’s 8 foot) of stitching in a pair of gloves and at Cornelia James we have spent over 70 years trying to make each stitch perfect. And we've got a Royal Warrant - glovemakers by appointment to Her Majesty the Queen.<\/p>",

It’s a mechanical marvel and now – 60 years on – just a little temperamental, as is its operator, who is Italian and passionate about perfect button holes.<\/p>"
